# C++: From Beginner to Expert [Video]
This is the code repository for [C++: From Beginner to Expert [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/c-beginner-expert-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
During the course we will write many programs that will make you a great programmer. All of this is presented by a young man who shares his knowledge, so the language used can be easily understood by everyone. The course is designed for those who don't have any prior knowledge about programming. It doesn't matter if you have never written any programs or you have no idea about programming... After my course all of this will change. You will bust the myth that programming is a difficult thing only for the few! After this course you will be able to use the advanced components of the C++ language.
